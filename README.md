# CS_450_ML_Week01
Getting Started with machine learning using naive bayes classification by reading the iris dataset from a csv and using sklearn.GausianNB


# naive_bayes_cli.py

This is a small command line app that takes in the iris dataset from a CSV file runs GaussianNB on it and then lets the user input different
dimensions and predict what type of iris it will be

Note: There is no input validation for the dimensions
